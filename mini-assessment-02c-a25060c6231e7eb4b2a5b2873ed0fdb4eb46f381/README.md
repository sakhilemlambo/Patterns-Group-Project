# Problems - Hangman Loops

* Modify `patterns.py` to solve the problem as stated in [_TODO_ ref to content's problem description].
* You can run the program using the instructions in *To Run* below.
* You can test technical correctness by running the unit tests as in the section *To Test* below.

### To Run

* `python3 patterns.py`
* follow the input prompts to run the program

### To Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_patterns.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step *1*: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_patterns.MyTestCase.test_1_shape`
* _Note_: at the minimum, these (*unedited*) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution.
